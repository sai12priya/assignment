# Explanation to my solution

Firstly, what I have done is I created dictionary to store employee data in the format like: -
WFS000065 ; REsaXiaWE, XAis { (09/12/2023 10:08 AM, 3:45); (09/12/2023 02:23 PM, 4:39); (09/13/2023 10:08 AM, 4:12); (09/13/2023 02:50 PM, 5:54); (09/14/2023 10:09 AM, 4:21); (09/14/2023 03:00 PM, 4:14); (09/15/2023 10:11 AM, 4:30); (09/15/2023 03:11 PM, 3:54); (09/16/2023 09:51 AM, 4:59); (09/16/2023 03:20 PM, 4:59); (09/19/2023 09:55 AM, 4:01); (09/19/2023 02:26 PM, 4:03); (09/20/2023 09:54 AM, 4:18); (09/20/2023 02:42 PM, 4:04); (09/21/2023 09:55 AM, 4:08); (09/21/2023 02:33 PM, 4:14); (09/22/2023 09:55 AM, 4:55); (09/22/2023 03:20 PM, 5:06); (09/23/2023 09:55 AM, 6:52)}

I have done this because we organizing like this its simpler to solve the problem.You can find the code in main.py file and output in output.txt.
